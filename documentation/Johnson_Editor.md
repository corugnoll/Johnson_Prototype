# Johnson Contract Editor

I want you to write me a contract perk tree editor for the Johnson game.  
This will be used in prototyping to better generate our contracts.  
One important feature this

## Editing Workflow

These features are for the creation and editing workflow of contract perk trees.

* Can create nodes  
* Can edit nodes by clicking on them and then adjusting their specs according to what nodes currently have: Node ID, Description, Effect Desc, Effect 1, Effect 2, Type, Color, Connections. Layer and Slot would not be needed anymore in this concept  
* Can drag nodes around on the canvas to freely position them.  
* Connection lines should either update in realtime, or if its easier have a “build connecitons” button that then redraws all connection-lines according to our rules (only straight lines and 90° angles) after a user has positioned nodes  
* Grid-Snapping for node positioning would be a great feature if possible

## Structural Features

- Option to export the tree to CSV (or a file format you see fit that can still be imported well into the main game).. This should contain all nodes, their data and also positioning information so that the main game can import these trees and recreate them 1:1 in the “Contract Tree” canvas area  
- Option to open existing contract-csv’s to edit them and iterate on them.

## Impact on Main Game

This editor would have the following impact on the main game and thus needs reworks for that aswell:

- The Contract Tree canvas is reworked so that it can have nodes positioned more freely and uses the editors CSV as a guide to where to place them. This means the whole “Layer” and “Slot” functionality would probably be removed and replaced either with a grid functionality, or by just defining actual positions (whichever you deem to work better)  
- The game can now load these “new” CSV files generated by the editor instead of the current CSVs (which would hopefully only require some slight adjustments since the only thing that really changes is positioning information)
