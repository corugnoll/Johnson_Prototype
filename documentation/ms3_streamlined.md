## Conclusion

This streamlined Milestone 3 focuses exclusively on completing the core game loop for prototype validation. By removing production-ready features like complex guidance systems, advanced persistence, and competitive play features, we can deliver a fully functional prototype that validates the core game mechanics efficiently.

The implementation leverages the strong foundation from Milestones 1-2 to add only the essential missing piece: contract execution with basic results display. This creates a complete, testable game loop suitable for iterative development and user feedback without over-engineering features not needed for prototype validation.
