## Actual Implementation Analysis

### Visual Prototype Approach: What Was Built

The Johnson Prototype successfully implemented a **"Visual Prototype"** approach that consolidated the originally planned 4 sub-milestones (MS1A-MS1D) into a single, integrated implementation. This approach proved more effective than the sequential plan.

### Implemented Module Architecture

## Technical Patterns and Architecture Decisions

### 1. Module Integration Strategy

**Decision:** Consolidated related functionality into larger, cohesive modules
- `visualPrototype.js` combines canvas management, rendering, layout, and interaction
- `csvLoader.js` includes data structures, validation, and parsing
- `gameState.js` integrates state management with calculation framework

**Impact:**
- ✅ Reduced inter-module dependencies
- ✅ Easier debugging and maintenance
- ✅ Better performance through reduced abstraction overhead
- ⚠️ Larger individual files requiring careful organization

### 2. Data Structure Enhancement

**Decision:** Implemented `VisualNode` and `VisualContractData` classes beyond specification
```javascript
class VisualNode {
    constructor(csvRow) {
        // Core properties from CSV
        this.id = csvRow['Node ID'];
        this.description = csvRow['Description'];
        // ... standard properties

        // Enhanced properties for visual prototype
        this.state = 'available';
        this.position = null;
        this.connections = new Set();
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Optimized for both rendering and game logic
- ✅ Built-in state management for visual interactions
- ✅ Efficient connection graph representation
- ✅ Extensible for future feature additions

### 3. Canvas Rendering Integration

**Decision:** Built complete rendering system with real-time interaction
- High-DPI support with `devicePixelRatio` handling
- Interactive node selection with visual state management
- Connection line rendering with pathfinding
- Responsive canvas sizing and viewport management

**Impact:**
- ✅ Exceeded original visualization requirements
- ✅ Immediate user feedback and engagement
- ✅ Professional visual quality
- ✅ Foundation for advanced animations (MS3)

### 4. Real-time Calculation Framework

**Decision:** Implemented live preview system beyond original MS1 scope
```javascript
// Real-time calculation integration
calculateCurrentPools() {
    // Reset pools
    this.currentPools = this.initializePools();

    // Add effects from selected nodes
    this.selectedNodes.forEach(nodeId => {
        const node = this.getNodeById(nodeId);
        if (node) {
            this.applyNodeEffects(node);
        }
    });

    // Apply prevention mechanics (partial implementation)
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Better user experience than planned
- ✅ Foundation for complex calculations (MS2)
- ⚠️ Needs completion of all condition types and operators

## Actual vs. Planned Dependencies

### Original Dependency Chain (MS1A → MS1B → MS1C → MS1D)

**MS1A Dependencies:** None (foundational)
**MS1B Dependencies:** MS1A completion
**MS1C Dependencies:** MS1B completion
**MS1D Dependencies:** MS1C completion

**Total Sequential Time:** 12-17 days across 4 phases

### Actual Implementation Dependencies (Visual Prototype)

**Integration Dependencies:** All components developed together
**Technical Dependencies:**
- Papa Parse library (external)
- Canvas API (browser)
- ES6 modules (browser)
- File API (browser)

**Total Integrated Time:** ~8-10 days (estimated actual implementation time)

### Updated Dependency Matrix for Future Milestones

| Milestone | Dependencies | Status | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **MS2: Game Logic** | Visual Prototype foundation | ✅ Ready | LOW |
| **MS3: Advanced Features** | MS2 completion | Dependent | MEDIUM |
| **MS4: Production** | MS2-3 completion | Dependent | LOW |

## Integration Patterns and Module Interactions

### Current Module Communication

**Main Application Flow:**
```
main.js
├── Coordinates all modules
├── Handles file loading events
├── Manages application lifecycle
└── Provides global error handling

csvLoader.js
├── Parses CSV files with Papa Parse
├── Creates VisualNode and VisualContractData objects
├── Validates data structure and relationships
└── Provides data to gameState and visualPrototype

gameState.js
├── Manages runner configuration
├── Handles node selection state
├── Calculates current stat pools (partial)
├── Validates game rules and configurations
└── Provides state to UI and visual systems

visualPrototype.js
├── Renders nodes and connections on canvas
├── Handles mouse interaction and selection
├── Manages visual states and animations
├── Integrates with gameState for state updates
└── Provides visual feedback to users

ui.js
├── Updates DOM elements with current state
├── Handles form validation and user input
├── Manages display of calculated values
├── Provides user feedback and error messages
└── Coordinates with all other modules
```

### Data Flow Patterns

**Contract Loading Flow:**
```
User File Input → csvLoader.parseCSV() → VisualContractData creation →
gameState.setContractData() → visualPrototype.loadContract() →
ui.updateContractDisplay()
```

**Real-time Calculation Flow:**
```
User Input (runner/node selection) → gameState.calculateCurrentPools() →
ui.updatePoolsDisplay() → visualPrototype.render() (if visual state changed)
```

**State Management Pattern:**
```
Central State (gameState.js) ↔ Visual State (visualPrototype.js)
                ↕
UI State (ui.js) ↔ User Input Events (main.js)
```
