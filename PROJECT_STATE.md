### Data Flow
```
CSV File/Library → CSVLoader → GameState → VisualPrototypeRenderer → Canvas
                                    ↓
Runner Generation → GameState.hiredRunners → EffectCalculator → Pools
                                    ↓
Node Selection → updateAvailableNodes() → calculateCurrentPools() → UI Update
                                    ↓
Contract Execution → DamageEvaluator → RunnerManager → Results Modal
```

### Key Dependencies
- **Papa Parse**: CSV parsing (client-side, CORS-friendly)
- **Canvas API**: All rendering
- **SessionStorage**: Game state persistence
- **No server required**: 100% client-side application

## 9. Development Workflow

### Code Organization Principles
1. **DRY**: Shared utilities in js/utils/
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has clear purpose
3. **Modularity**: Game and editor share common code
4. **No Build Step**: Direct browser execution (except data embedding)

### Data Update Workflow
1. Edit CSV files in Tools/ directory
2. Run `node Tools/generate-balancing-embedded.js`
3. Run `node Tools/generate-contract-library.js` (if contracts changed)
4. Commit updated resourceData.js and contractLibrary.js

### Adding New Features
1. Read CLAUDE.md for architecture guidelines
2. Check existing utilities in js/utils/
3. Update gameState.js for new state properties
4. Update ui.js for new UI elements
5. Test in browser (no build required)
6. Document in PROJECT_STATE.md

### Browser Compatibility
- **Target**: Modern browsers (2020+)
- **Tested**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Mobile**: Android tablet touch support
- **Protocol**: Works with file:// and http://

{
  playerMoney: number,
  playerRisk: number,
  playerLevel: number,
  contractsCompleted: number,
  hiredRunners: Array<Runner>,
  generatedRunners: Array<Runner>,
  previouslyHiredRunners: Array<Runner>,
  timestamp: number
}
```

---

## 12. Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- **Node Count**: Tested up to 50 nodes smoothly
- **Target**: 100 nodes without lag
- **Render**: Canvas-based, efficient redraws
- **Calculations**: Multi-pass optimized with early returns

### Performance Bottlenecks (if they occur)
1. Large contract files (100+ nodes) - Not currently an issue
2. Complex effect chains - Handled by multi-pass system
3. Frequent recalculations - Minimized by smart state management

### Optimization Strategies
- Early return in condition evaluation
- Cached calculations where possible
- Efficient Set/Map usage for lookups
- Minimal DOM manipulation
